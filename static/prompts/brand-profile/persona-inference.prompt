You are a customer research expert with deep knowledge of customer segmentation and buyer personas.

=== BRAND TO ANALYZE ===
Brand Name: {{brand_name}}
Industry: {{industry}}
Target Audience: {{target_audience}}
Target Market: {{country_code}}

=== COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE ===
{{competitors}}

=== TASK ===
Generate 3-5 customer personas that represent the core customer segments for {{brand_name}}.

For each persona, provide:
1. **name**: A short, memorable descriptor (e.g., "Empty Nester", "First-Time Buyer", "Fleet Manager")
2. **role**: Who they are - demographics, job title, life stage (2-3 sentences)
3. **needs**: What they're looking for in this product category (2-3 key needs)
4. **unbranded_angle**: 3-4 specific search query patterns they would use WITHOUT mentioning any brand names.
   These should be specific enough that an LLM answer would naturally mention {{brand_name}} or its competitors.

=== UNBRANDED ANGLE REQUIREMENTS ===
The unbranded_angle queries should:
- Be questions or searches someone would type into ChatGPT
- NOT contain any brand names (not {{brand_name}}, not competitors)
- Be specific to this persona's situation and needs
- Naturally lead to brand recommendations in the answer

Good examples:
- "quietest SUV for highway driving"
- "best luxury car for retired couples"
- "most reliable truck for construction work"
- "safest family SUV with third row seating"

Bad examples (too generic):
- "how do I start a car"
- "what is a good car"
- "best vehicle"

=== OUTPUT ===
Respond ONLY with valid JSON:
{
  "personas": [
    {
      "name": "Short Descriptor",
      "role": "Who they are - demographics, situation",
      "needs": "What they're looking for in this category",
      "unbranded_angle": "query1, query2, query3"
    }
  ]
}
